  <p> Hello there, my name is JJUUKO MUBARAK. I am a moslem from Uganda, the Pearl of Africa.I am the eldest of my four siblings. I got to know and join BYU through my Dad's best friend who is a member of the church together with his whole family, his young brother is also a leader in the church back here in Kololo ward.
    I am a business man currently dealing in fresh foods supply from our neighboring coutries, Kenya and South Sudan imorting and exporting food stuffs such as irish potatoes(mainly), carrots and tomatoes.
    I am usually caught up between work and studies making me finish up most of assignments a little bit late and contribute less to group discussions, although I am currently trying to adjust my schedule to make sure that I give in more time to my studies.
    I am glad to be part and are willing to work with all of you and contribute in any way to the best of knowledge and scope of resorces I can offer.
